# Road radius detector

This tool implements the [RALPH system](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub2/pomerleau_dean_1995_2/pomerleau_dean_1995_2.pdf) along the a TensorFlow model to detect the radius of a road on an image based on the trend taken by lines parallel to the street. It should thus be even able to recognize the curve of snowy roads, since those still have parallel features. The only parameters that need to be fed to the system are camera inclination, camera height from the ground, and camera FOV.
